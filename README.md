# Abstract
Predicting customer churn is essential for businesses across sectors, enabling proactive actions to retain customers and improve satisfaction. This project focuses on forecasting churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

-The dataset comprises customer demographics, service details, and churn status.

-Various machine learning algorithms are assessed, including logistic regression, decision trees, gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks.

-The workflow involves data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

-Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

-A comparative analysis identifies the most effective algorithm.

This project's insights, derived from thorough analysis and testing of diverse machine learning methods, offer valuable potential to optimize customer retention strategies.
